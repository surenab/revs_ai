- **Naming**: Use lowercase with underscores or hyphens (e.g., `dashboard.png`)

## How to Take Screenshots

1. Start your development server
2. Navigate to each page
3. Take a screenshot (use browser dev tools or screenshot tool)
4. Save with the appropriate filename in this directory
5. The images will automatically appear in the README

## Alternative: Using Relative Paths

If you prefer to store images elsewhere, you can use relative paths in the README:

```markdown
![Dashboard](./path/to/your/image.png)
```

Or use absolute paths from the repository root:

```markdown
![Dashboard](docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)
```
